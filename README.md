# Python Class Methods: An Introduction
In Python, classes are a way to define custom data
types that can store data and define functions that can
manipulate that dhata. One type of function that can be
defined within a class is called a "method." In this blog
post, we will explore what Python class methods are, 
why they are useful, and how to use them.

# What are Python Class Methods?
A class method is a type of method that is bound to the 
class and not the instance of the class. In other words,
it operates on the class as a whole, rather than on a 
specific instance of the class. Class methods are 
defined using the "@classmethod" decorator, followed
by a function definition. The first argument of the 
function is always "cls," which represents the class
itself
